# wiki-annotate

same as git annotate but for wiki

## development

## Prerequisites

* wiki-annotate was tested on python 3.9 but it should work on python 3.5<

* for frontend magic, node10 and npm

## Quickstart

recomendation is to use [venv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/)

1. create venv, with python3 is `python3 -m pip .venv`. This will create a folder `.venv` and to activate it, `source .venv/bin/activate`
2. `pip install -e .` will install package `wiki-annotate`
3. Happy hacking
